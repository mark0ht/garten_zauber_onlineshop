    Frühlingswetter Shop was founded in 1995 with a mission to bring the charm of springtime to every household in Germany. Our founders, Hans and Greta Müller, were inspired by the beautiful landscapes of the Bavarian Alps and wanted to share that natural beauty with the world. With a focus on sustainability and eco-friendly practices, Frühlingswetter Shop aims to provide high-quality, environmentally-conscious products that bring joy and freshness to everyday life.
